##Project Description
The DotNetNuke® Blog module is an easy to use content publishing module that is tightly integrated with the core DotNetNuke® framework. The module also permits content authoring using off-site tools such as Windows Live Writer.

##How can I help?
We regularly get offers for help. The best way to help out right now is to try the module and, if something doesn't work, to *try to find out why this happened*. This helps us enormously. Then report the issue under "Issues".

Particularly _unhelpful_ are bug reports that are vague (e.g. "The module doesn't work") or rants about how feature XYZ, that is very dear to you, is now no longer there or missing. Such issues may just end up getting closed without a response.
